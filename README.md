# Analysis of honey bee colony pesticide feeding study data using the VarroaPop+Pesticide model and Approximate Bayesian Computation.

This code supports **Minucci et al. 2019.** *Inferring pesticide toxicity to honey bees from a field-based feeding study using a colony dynamics model and Bayesian inference*

<br>

We utilize the VarroaPy python package, written by Jeffrey Minucci, which wraps the VarroaPop+Pesticide program (written in C++ and the MFC library). This package is included as a submodule, but it's standalone repo can be found [here.](https://github.com/quanted/VarroaPy/)

#### If Github is not rendering the Jupyter Notebook files (*.ipynb), which seems to be an intermittent issue with their backend, you can view them on [Jupyter's nbviewer.](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JeffreyMinucci/bee_neonic_abc/tree/master/)
