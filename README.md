# bee_neonic_abc
Analysis of honey bee colony neonicotinoid feeding study data, using the VarroaPop+Pesticide model and Approximate Bayesian Computation.

This code supports **Minucci et al. 2019.** *Inferring pesticide toxicity to honey bees from a field-based feeding study using a colony dynamics model and Bayesian inference*

This project utilizes the VarroaPy python package, written by Jeffrey Minucci, which wraps the VarroaPop+Pesticide program (written in C++ and the MFC library). It can be found at: https://github.com/quanted/VarroaPy/
