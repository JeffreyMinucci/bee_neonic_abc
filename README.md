# Analysis of honey bee colony pesticide feeding study data using the VarroaPop+Pesticide model and Approximate Bayesian Computation.

This code supports **Minucci et al. 2019.** *Inferring pesticide toxicity to honey bees from a field-based feeding study using a colony dynamics model and Bayesian inference*

<br>

We utilize the VarroaPy python package, written by Jeffrey Minucci, which wraps the VarroaPop+Pesticide program (written in C++ and the MFC library). This package is included as a submodule, but it's standalone repo can be found [here.](https://github.com/quanted/VarroaPy/)
