If there are many more sub-adults than adults, and bees live just as long (or longer) as adults than as sub-adults, the population is forced to grow - unless there is pesticide (or Varroa) mortality. VarroaPop is able to bring the adult population #s back down to the observed values only by letting pupae and larvae numbers drop to well below the observed values (and back to what seems to be a 'typical' age structure of hives with stable colony size). \n",
